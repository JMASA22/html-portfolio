<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Jana, if you don't find me in front of the computer, I'll be in front of the sea or enjoying my family and friends.
  Thanks to my passion for photography, I started in the audiovisual and communications world. I graduated in audiovisual image and started audiovisual design, although in the end I graduated in graphic design. 
  I have done Community Management, Digital Marketing and SEO courses. Currently I am studying a bootcamp: "Become a Full-Stack Web Developer with just ONE course. HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, React, MongoDB, Web3 and DApps" to broaden my skills.</p>
